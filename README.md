# Visualization of COVID-19 Epidemic in The Netherlands

_A statistic of waste disposal in the city of Austin, Texas. Including descriptive statistics and inferential statistics using T test and rate-of-change analysis._

---

# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the Austin waste disposal system from Google Cloud BigQuery. It is a public data of garbage and waste loads disposed throughout the city of Austin. The data includes load type, weight, disposal site and time of report.

# Project Summary

## Background

The city of Austin has given us a list of waste disposal log and tasked us to provide a statistics of the data. Other than that, they are planning to expand the city's waste processing capacity and asking for our recommendation based on the statistics.

## Objectives

We want to produce a statistics from the log and take note of distinguished processing facilities based on load type and amount they process. From there, we are going to make prediction of requirements of a new waste processing facility.

## Methods

- We are going to clean the data from missing values as well as values that are considered outliers.

- From the cleaned data, we are going to perform descriptive statistics to look how every processing site handles the waste loads.

- We are going to choose a site and perform inferential statistics on it to find out more information and make prediction of requirements of a new waste processing facility.

- All of these are going to be done with Numpy and Pandas library on a Python Notebook file.

## Results

- Produced statistics of where do waste from Austin is processed.

- Chose Texas Disposal System Landfill (TDSL) as the site to be examined.

- Produced recommendation for capacity requirements of a new waste processing facility based on performance of TDSL.

- Made prediction model of waste produced by the city of Austin.
