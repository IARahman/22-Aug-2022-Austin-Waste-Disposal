## Methods

- We are going to clean the data and do queries with grouping and aggregating before serving the data in tables and graphs

- All of these are going to be done with Pandas library on a Python Notebook file.

## Results

- Cleaned up the dataset from unnecessary and incomplete data while renaming and reformatting columns for better performance.
